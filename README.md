# archive
to preserve the books, people, and words that sharpened my thinking


## What You’ll Find Here

### Things I Adore
Projects, ideas, designs, moments, and little inspirations that mean something to me.  
Some are simple, some experimental — all of them are here because I like them.

## Why I Made This

I wanted one place where I could:

- collect memories and ideas
- look back and see how I’ve grown
- keep inspiration together
- share what matters to me

This archive will keep growing over time, slowly, honestly, and one thought at a time.
